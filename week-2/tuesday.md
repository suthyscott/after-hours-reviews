The prime directive of these reviews is to answer the students' questions and clarify content they don't understand. Seeing the content from another angle (oustide of lecture and afternoon projects) can help bridge gaps in understanding. I've found it helpful to ask for feedback the day of the review and get a feel for what might be weak spots in their understanding.  

Once any specific questions have been answered the focus for this review should be HTML/CSS-2 and vanilla JavaScript.
